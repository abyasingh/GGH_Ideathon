# Weather App Using AI Tools

The goal of this project is to develop AI tools to continuously monitor the environmental data and provide suitable visuals and inferences from the past as well as current state of the environment. The four features essential for this problem are air quality, water pollution level, deforestation rate and climate pattern. 
Different models based on machine learning and deep learning concepts were trained to cover each of these topics exhaustively.  
An application was eventually built on top of these to show various trends and plots from the model and to allow the user check the state of weather based on the integarted results from the sections.   

Note: The dataset for each section has been uploaded in the suitably named directory.
